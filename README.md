## Project Description:
This Tableau project focuses on the analysis of electric vehicle (EV) data across various dimensions, including vehicle eligibility, electric range, distribution by state, vehicle models, and trends over the years. The analysis aims to provide insights into the adoption of electric vehicles, the dominance of specific manufacturers, and the distribution of EVs across the United States.

## Insights from the Dashboard:

### Key Performance Indicator:
The dashboard reports a total of 1,50,422 electric vehicles, with 77.6% being Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and 22.4% being Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

### Average Electric Range:
The average electric range across all vehicles is 67.83 miles, indicating the average distance EVs can travel on a full charge.

### Top EV Manufacturers:
Tesla dominates the electric vehicle market with 52.70% of the total vehicles (68,943 units).
Other major manufacturers include Nissan (10.32%), Chevrolet (9.19%), and Ford (5.81%).

### Vehicle Models:
The top models are Tesla Model Y is 18.95% and Tesla Model 3 is 17.80% of total vehicles, followed by the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt EV.

### State-Wise Distribution:
The state map indicates significant adoption of EVs in a few states, with the highest concentration in certain regions. For example, one state has 1,50,082 vehicles.

### Trends Over the Years:
The line chart shows a significant increase in EV adoption, particularly peaking in 2023 with 37.1K vehicles. There is a visible surge in EV adoption starting from 2018.
